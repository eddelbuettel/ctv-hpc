This CRAN task view contains a list of packages, grouped by topic, that are useful for high-performance computing (HPC) with R. In this context, we are defining 'high-performance computing' rather loosely as just about anything related to pushing R a little further: using compiled code, parallel computing (in both explicit and implicit modes), working with large objects as well as profiling.

Unless otherwise mentioned, all packages presented with hyperlinks are available from CRAN, the Comprehensive R Archive Network.

Several of the areas discussed in this Task View are undergoing rapid change. Please send suggestions for additions and extensions for this task view to the [task view maintainer](mailto:Dirk.Eddelbuettel@R-project.org).

Suggestions and corrections by Achim Zeileis, Markus Schmidberger, Martin Morgan, Max Kuhn, Tomas Radivoyevitch, Jochen Knaus, Tobias Verbeke, Hao Yu, David Rosenberg, Marco Enea, Ivo Welch, Jay Emerson, Wei-Chen Chen, Bill Cleveland, Ross Boylan, Ramon Diaz-Uriarte, Mark Zeligman, Kevin Ushey, Graham Jeffries, and Will Landau (as well as others I may have forgotten to add here) are gratefully acknowledged.

Contributions are always welcome, and encouraged. Since the start of this CRAN task view in October 2008, most contributions have arrived as email suggestions. The source file for this particular task view file now also reside in a GitHub repository (see below) so that pull requests are also possible.

The `ctv` package supports these Task Views. Its functions `install.views` and `update.views` allow, respectively, installation or update of packages from a given Task View; the option `coreOnly` can restrict operations to packages labeled as *core* below.

**Direct support in R started with release 2.14.0** which includes a new package **parallel** incorporating (slightly revised) copies of packages multicore and [snow](https://cran.r-project.org/package=snow/index.html). Some types of clusters are not handled directly by the base package 'parallel'. However, and as explained in the package [vignette](https://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-devel/library/parallel/doc/parallel.pdf), the parts of parallel which provide [snow](../packages/snow/index.html) -like functions will accept [snow](../packages/snow) clusters including MPI clusters.
The **parallel** package also contains support for multiple RNG streams following L'Ecuyer et al (2002), with support for both mclapply and snow clusters.
The version released for R 2.14.0 contains base functionality: higher-level convenience functions are planned for later R releases.

**Parallel computing: Explicit parallelism**

-   Several packages provide the communications layer required for parallel computing. The first package in this area was rpvm by Li and Rossini which uses the PVM (Parallel Virtual Machine) standard and libraries. rpvm is no longer actively maintained, but available from its CRAN archive directory.
-   In recent years, the alternative MPI (Message Passing Interface) standard has become the de facto standard in parallel computing. It is supported in R via the [Rmpi](https://cran.r-project.org/package=Rmpi/index.html) by Yu. [Rmpi](../packages/Rmpi/index.html) package is mature yet actively maintained and offers access to numerous functions from the MPI API, as well as a number of R-specific extensions. [Rmpi](../packages/Rmpi) can be used with the LAM/MPI, MPICH / MPICH2, Open MPI, and Deino MPI implementations. It should be noted that LAM/MPI is now in maintenance mode, and new development is focused on Open MPI.
-   The [pbdMPI](https://cran.r-project.org/package=pbdMPI/index.html) package provides S4 classes to directly interface MPI in order to support the Single Program/Multiple Data (SPMD) parallel programming style which is particularly useful for batch parallel execution. The [pbdSLAP](../packages/pbdSLAP/index.html) builds on this and uses scalable linear algebra packages (namely BLACS, PBLAS, and ScaLAPACK) in double precision based on ScaLAPACK version 2.0.2. The [pbdBASE](../packages/pbdBASE/index.html) builds on these and provides the core classes and methods for distributed data types upon which the [pbdDMAT](../packages/pbdDMAT/index.html) builds to provide distributed dense matrices for "Programming with Big Data". The [pbdNCDF4](../packages/pbdNCDF4/index.html) package permits multiple processes to write to the same file (without manual synchronization) and supports terabyte-sized files. The [pbdDEMO](../packages/pbdDEMO/index.html) package provides examples for these packages, and a detailed vignette. The [pbdPROF](../packages/pbdPROF) package profiles MPI communication SPMD code via MPI profiling libraries, such as fpmpi, mpiP, or TAU.
-   An alternative is provided by the [nws](https://cran.r-project.org/package=nws) (NetWorkSpaces) packages from REvolution Computing. It is the successor to the earlier LindaSpaces approach to parallel computing, and is implemented on top of the Twisted networking toolkit for Python.
-   The [snow](https://cran.r-project.org/package=snow/index.html) (Simple Network of Workstations) package by Tierney et al. can use PVM, MPI, NWS as well as direct networking sockets. It provides an abstraction layer by hiding the communications details. The [snowFT](../packages/snowFT/index.html) package provides fault-tolerance extensions to [snow](../packages/snow).
-   The [snowfall](https://cran.r-project.org/package=snowfall/index.html) package by Knaus provides a more recent alternative to [snow](../packages/snow). Functions can be used in sequential or parallel mode.
-   The [foreach](https://cran.r-project.org/package=foreach/index.html) package allows general iteration over elements in a collection without the use of an explicit loop counter. Using foreach without side effects also facilitates executing the loop in parallel which is possible via the [doMC](../packages/doMC/index.html) (using parallel/multicore on single workstations), [doSNOW](../packages/doSNOW/index.html) (using [snow](../packages/snow/index.html), see above), [doMPI](../packages/doMPI/index.html) (using [Rmpi](../packages/Rmpi/index.html)) packages, [doFuture](../packages/doFuture/index.html) (using [future](../packages/future/index.html) or [future.BatchJobs](../packages/future.BatchJobs/index.html)), and [doRedis](../packages/doRedis/index.html) (using [rredis](../packages/rredis)) packages.
-   The [future](https://cran.r-project.org/package=future) package allows for synchronous (sequential) and asynchronous (parallel) evaluations via abstraction of futures, either via function calls or implicitly via promises. Global variables are automatically identified. Iteration over elements in a collection is supported.
-   The [Rborist](https://cran.r-project.org/package=Rborist) package employs OpenMP pragmas to exploit predictor-level parallelism in the Random Forest algorithm which promotes efficient use of multicore hardware in restaging data and in determining splitting criteria, both of which are performance bottlenecks in the algorithm.
-   The [h2o](https://cran.r-project.org/package=h2o) package connects to the h2o open source machine learning environment which has scalable implementations of random forests, GBM, GLM (with elastic net regularization), and deep learning.
-   The [randomForestSRC](https://cran.r-project.org/package=randomForestSRC) package can use both OpenMP as well as MPI for random forest extensions suitable for survival analysis, competing risks analysis, classification as well as regression
-   The [parSim](https://cran.r-project.org/package=parSim) package can perform simulation studies using one or multiple cores, both locally and on HPC clusters.

**Parallel computing: Implicit parallelism**

-   The pnmath package by Tierney ( [link](http://www.stat.uiowa.edu/~luke/R/experimental/)) uses the Open MP parallel processing directives of recent compilers (such gcc 4.2 or later) for implicit parallelism by replacing a number of internal R functions with replacements that can make use of multiple cores --- without any explicit requests from the user. The alternate pnmath0 package offers the same functionality using Pthreads for environments in which the newer compilers are not available. Similar functionality is expected to become integrated into R 'eventually'.
-   The romp package by Jamitzky was presented at useR! 2008 ( [slides](http://www.statistik.tu-dortmund.de/useR-2008/slides/Jamitzky.pdf)) and offers another interface to Open MP using Fortran. The code is still pre-alpha and available from the Google Code project [<span class="Gcode">romp</span>](https://code.google.com/p/romp/). An R-Forge project [<span class="Rforge">romp</span>](https://R-Forge.R-project.org/projects/romp/) was initiated but there is no package, yet.
-   The R/parallel package by Vera, Jansen and Suppi offers a C++-based master-slave dispatch mechanism for parallel execution ( [link](http://www.rparallel.org/))
-   The [Rdsm](https://cran.r-project.org/package=Rdsm) package provides a threads-like parallel computing environment, both on multicore machine and across the network by providing facilities inspired from distributed shared memory programming.
-   The [RhpcBLASctl](https://cran.r-project.org/package=RhpcBLASctl) package detects the number of available BLAS cores, and permits explicit selection of the number of cores.
-   The [Rhpc](https://cran.r-project.org/package=Rhpc) permits `*apply()` style dispatch via MPI.
-   The [drake](https://cran.r-project.org/package=drake) package is an R-focused pipeline similar to [Make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make). Parallel computing relies on the `parallel`, `future`, `batchtools`, and `future.batchtools` packages, as well as [Makefiles](https://www.gnu.org/software/make). Drake uses code analysis to configure the user's workflow and make the parallelism implicit.

**Parallel computing: Grid computing**

-   The multiR package by Grose was presented at useR! 2008 but has not been released. It may offer a snow-style framework on a grid computing platform.
-   The [<span class="Rforge">biocep-distrib</span>](https://R-Forge.R-project.org/projects/biocep-distrib/) project by Chine offers a Java-based framework for local, Grid, or Cloud computing. It is under active development.

-   The rmr package by Revolution Analytics also provides an interface between R and Hadoop for a Map/Reduce programming framework. ( [link](https://github.com/RevolutionAnalytics/RHadoop/wiki/rmr))
-   A related package, segue package by Long, permits easy execution of embarassingly parallel task on Elastic Map Reduce (EMR) at Amazon. ( [link](http://code.google.com/p/segue/))
-   The [RProtoBuf](https://cran.r-project.org/package=RProtoBuf) package provides an interface to Google's language-neutral, platform-neutral, extensible mechanism for serializing structured data. This package can be used in R code to read data streams from other systems in a distributed MapReduce setting where data is serialized and passed back and forth between tasks.
-   The [HistogramTools](https://cran.r-project.org/package=HistogramTools) package provides a number of routines useful for the construction, aggregation, manipulation, and plotting of large numbers of Histograms such as those created by Mappers in a MapReduce application.
-   The [toaster](https://cran.r-project.org/package=toaster) package performs in-database computations utilizing the parallel / distributed Teradata Aster analytical platform

**Parallel computing: Random numbers**

-   Random-number generators for parallel computing are available via the [rlecuyer](https://cran.r-project.org/package=rlecuyer) package by Sevcikova and Rossini.
-   The [doRNG](https://cran.r-project.org/package=doRNG) package provides functions to perform reproducible parallel foreach loops, using independent random streams as generated by the package rstream, suitable for the different foreach backends.

**Parallel computing: Resource managers and batch schedulers**

-   Job-scheduling toolkits permit management of parallel computing resources and tasks. The slurm (Simple Linux Utility for Resource Management) set of programs works well with MPI and slurm jobs can be submitted from R using the [rslurm](https://cran.r-project.org/package=rslurm) package. ( [link](http://slurm.schedmd.com/))
-   The Condor toolkit ( [link](http://www.cs.wisc.edu/condor/)) from the University of Wisconsin-Madison has been used with R as described in this [R News article](http://www.r-project.org/doc/Rnews/Rnews_2005-2.pdf).
-   The sfCluster package by Knaus can be used with [snowfall](https://cran.r-project.org/package=snowfall). ( [link](http://www.imbi.uni-freiburg.de/parallel/)) but is currently limited to LAM/MPI.
-   The [batch](https://cran.r-project.org/package=batch) package by Hoffmann can launch parallel computing requests onto a cluster and gather results.
-   The [BatchJobs](https://cran.r-project.org/package=BatchJobs/index.html) package provides Map, Reduce and Filter variants to manage R jobs and their results on batch computing systems like PBS/Torque, LSF and Sun Grid Engine. Multicore and SSH systems are also supported. The [BatchExperiments](../packages/BatchExperiments/index.html) package extends it with an abstraction layer for running statistical experiments. Package [batchtools](../packages/batchtools) is a successor / extension to both.
-   The [flowr](https://cran.r-project.org/package=flowr) package offers a scatter-gather approach to submit jobs lists (including dependencies) to the computing cluster via simple data.frames as inputs. It supports LSF, SGE, Torque and SLURM.
-   The [clustermq](https://cran.r-project.org/package=clustermq) package sends function calls as jobs on LSF, SGE and SLURM via a single line of code without using network-mounted storage. It also supports use of remote clusters via SSH.

**Large memory and out-of-memory data**

-   The [biglm](https://cran.r-project.org/package=biglm) package by Lumley uses incremental computations to offer `lm()` and `glm()` functionality to data sets stored outside of R's main memory.
-   The [ff](https://cran.r-project.org/package=ff) package by Adler et al. offers file-based access to data sets that are too large to be loaded into memory, along with a number of higher-level functions.
-   The [bigmemory](https://cran.r-project.org/package=bigmemory) package by Kane and Emerson permits storing large objects such as matrices in memory (as well as via files) and uses external pointer objects to refer to them. This permits transparent access from R without bumping against R's internal memory limits. Several R processes on the same computer can also share big memory objects.
-   A large number of database packages, and database-alike packages (such as [sqldf](https://cran.r-project.org/package=sqldf/index.html) by Grothendieck and [data.table](../packages/data.table) by Dowle) are also of potential interest but not reviewed here.

Together with [Rcpp](../packages/Rcpp), RcppParallel makes it easy to write safe, performant, concurrently-executing C++ code, and use that code within R and R packages.
-   The [rJava](https://cran.r-project.org/package=rJava) package by Urbanek provides a low-level interface to Java similar to the `.Call()` interface for C and C++.
-   The [reticulate](https://cran.r-project.org/package=reticulate/index.html) package by Allaire provides interface to Python modules, classes, and functions. It allows R users to access many high-performance Python packages such as [tensorflow](../packages/tensorflow/index.html) and [tfestimators](../packages/tfestimators) within R.
