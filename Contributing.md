## How to contribute

### tl;dr

Please just edit the corresponding `ctv` file in this repo, and file a pull request motivating the
change.

It might be best to limit each pull request to a single change.  Keep the pull request short and
focused, the format of the `ctv` file should be self-explanatory but there is documentation in the
corresponding R package (see below).

### Background

[CRAN Task Views](https://cran.r-project.org/web/views/) were started by [Achim
Zeileis](https://www.zeileis.org/) who is also (along with Kurt Hornik) the primary author of the
[ctv](http://cran.r-project.org/package=ctv) R package for processing the `ctv` files.

### Technology

The Task View file format is inspired by XML. It uses a similar scheme of 'tags'.  CTV files
processing is best done via the [ctv](http://cran.r-project.org/package=ctv) package.

### Edits

Task View files can be edited by hand with some care, especially with an editor supporting XML or
related markup language.

### Outlook

Some discussions have been ongoing about a possible reorganisation of Task Views.  Stay tuned.
